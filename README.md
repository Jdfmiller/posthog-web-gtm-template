# posthog-web-gtm-template

This is the repo for a posthog GTM template.

Generally this is to speed up the process of implementing posthog via GTM on the client side - by replacing the https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install (HTML) section.

Meaning you don't have to paste the snippet as a custom HTML tag in GTM. 

Eventually i'd like to update it to add in properties and some of the other features posthog offers.

To be clear I am in no way affiliated with posthog, I just think the tool is baller and it's about time it got a template in GTM.
