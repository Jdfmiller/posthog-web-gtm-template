# posthgo-web-gtm-template

This is the repo for a posthog GTM template.

Generally this is to speed up the process of implementing posthog via GTM - but the plan is to eventually expand it to make use of the HTML features.

To be clear I am in no way affiliated with posthog, I just think the tool is baller and it's about time it got a template in GTM.
